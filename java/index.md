[[The Hall of Fame](./fame.md)] shows off accomplishments of past and current students.

[[My Sample Code](./sample.md)] is a basic 2D application. It's long and complex, but worth it to try and alter - it will help you understand more complex concepts.

[[The Code Reference](./reference/index.md)] is Gold. Please Use This. It follows along with with the class rather well, explains things, and has examples.

### The Chat Room

Java class Week 5 found a chatroom program. One of you must be running the server,
and tell the server IP address to the others who want to join.

To join, you'll need **All Three** of the below programs.

[Client](../code/Client.java)
[ClientGUI](../code/ClientGUI.java)

### PLACE

I built this for a college class. It's more or less the Reddit Place Project.
Download the client below, read on for instructions.

[[Download Place Client](../code/unzipthis.zip)]

Short Instructions:

1. Download and unzip the file
2. Run clickme.bat
3. What to type in will be on my whiteboard.

Long Instructions:

1. Click `Download Place Client` up above.
2. Note where it's saving, hopefully in Downloads.
3. Click Save.
4. Click the little yellow folder at the bottom of your screen
5. Navigate to where you saved the .zip file, probably in Downloads
6. Right-Click it.
7. Hover over `7z`
8. Click on `Extract Here`
9. Two new files will appear.
10. double-click `clickme.bat`
11. It'll ask you what server to connect to. See my whiteboard.
12. It'll ask what port to use. See my whiteboard.
13. It'll ask for a username. use anything, just keep it zesty.
14. After you enter your username, it'll attempt to connect.
15. If it fails, ask someone nearbye that made it work for help.
16. Choose a color, then click somewhere to place that color.
17. Work *WITH* the people around you to create art.

If anyone starts battles with anyone else for space, the server will be shut down without hesitation.

- Keep it collaborative

Ask before moving into territory that may or may not be claimed.
