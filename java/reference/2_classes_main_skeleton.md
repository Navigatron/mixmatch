# The Skeleton Program

```java
public class filename
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Code
    }
}
```

#### public class filename

Classes are blueprints that define a thing. They take your code from nothing to *being something*.

`public` lets your code run. This is good. The opposite is `private`, which restricts access.

`class` is what makes this line what it is - a class declaration.

`filename` is the name of the class. **This must be the same as the name of the file.** `MyCode.java` would have a class called `MyCode`. `Board.java` would have a class called `Board`.

This line is followed by a code block, which contains everything inside the class. Classes can contain *Data*, and *Methods*. Data tells us something about the class, whereas Methods allow the class to do something.

#### public static void main(String[] args)

The Main method is where your program will start. Put any code you want to run inside the code block here.

#### TL;DR

Copy and Paste the Skeleton Program. Change `filename` to the name of the file it's saved in, without the `.java` at the end. Put code you want to run inside the `main` code block.
