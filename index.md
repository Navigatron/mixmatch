# Mixmatch's Java Class

One week of intense java action. Below you'll find sample code I've written as well as the **Hall of Fame**, which includes code from current and past students.

### Mixmatch's Sample Code

The below project will:  
- Create a Window.
- Show all the rectangles defined in the *buildWorld* method.
- Use the Keyboard to control the Green Square.
- Detect collisions between rectangles.

Challenges:
- Change the color of the player square.
- Change the default color of all rectangles.
- Make the camera follow the player. Hint:  `camera.position = player.position;`, somewhere in the *physics* method.

### Hall of Fame

##### Spinning Blue Sphere

This *processing project* creates a window with a blue sphere. Through keyboard controls, the user can rotate the sphere. If you need help setting up a *processing project*, just ask!

##### A Bowl of Rice

This *processing project* Will comfortably simulate one thousand or more rice on the screen. With the mouse, the user can push or pull the rice around.

- The code for rice-on-rice collisions is present, though not activated
- Try changing the force variable to change the entire behaviour of the physics!
