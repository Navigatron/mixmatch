# Mixmatch

What is good with it?

## Java Samples

#### Mixmatch's GUI thing

Hit go, and a window will appear. Press space to make the square go up. Try some of the following:

- Change the Colors.
- Decrease Gravity so it's slower.
- Draw another piece of flame, make it look like fire
- Left and right movement? (challenge)

**Update**: Version 2 is here.

This version is better, it's laid out in a much more intuitive way.

- Should be easier to Understand
- Should be easier to turn into something cool.

#### Zach's Rotating Sphere.

I'll have this up here soon. To run this, you'll need to create a new *Processing Project*.
